Shimmer
=======

Shimmer is a remote pairing video exchange tool.  It is an extremely simple and lightweight client-server for two buddies to share just video with minimal bandwidth.  Audio is not included at this stage.  It is assumed you will use Mumble or some other pure-audio exchange mechanism.

Currently video compression is achieved naievly and poorly by sending just the differences in glorious 24-bit RGB. This is too slow and leads to terrible image quality. Now examining WebM as an alternative.
