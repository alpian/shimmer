Shimmer
=======

Shimmer is a remote pairing video exchange tool.  It is an extremely simple and lightweight client-server for two buddies to share just video with minimal bandwidth.  Audio is not included at this stage.  It is assumed you will use Mumble or some other pure-audio exchange mechanism.

Frames are exchanged by sending the difference from the current to the last frame.  Compression is achieved currently only by reducing the color depth but fancier compression techniques are being investigated.
